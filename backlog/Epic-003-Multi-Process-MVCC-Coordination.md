# Epic 003: Multi-Process MVCC Coordination

## 🎯 Executive Summary

Following the substantial success of **Epic 002** which delivered exceptional single-process async performance (191.49 ops/sec, 3.8x improvement), Epic 003 addresses the critical gap for multi-process deployment by implementing file-based coordination while preserving the existing MVCC foundation and minimizing performance impact.

## 📊 Current System Status (Post-Epic 002)

### ✅ **Achievements from Epic-002:**
- **Async Performance:** 191.49 ops/sec throughput (96% of 200+ target)
- **I/O Optimization:** 91% flush reduction with real durability guarantees
- **Single-Process ACID:** Complete transaction isolation within process boundaries
- **Professional Infrastructure:** Comprehensive monitoring, testing, and async patterns
- **Production Ready:** Safe for single-process deployment scenarios

### 🚨 **Critical Multi-Process Gaps Identified:**
- **No Inter-Process Coordination:** Transaction state isolated to individual processes
- **MVCC Isolation Failure:** Snapshot isolation breaks across process boundaries
- **Data Corruption Risk:** Concurrent metadata updates cause race conditions
- **Lost Update Anomalies:** Multiple processes can write conflicting data silently
- **No Crash Recovery:** Process failures leave orphaned transactions
