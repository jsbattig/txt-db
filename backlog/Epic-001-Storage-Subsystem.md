# Epic 001: Generic Storage Subsystem

## Epic Description
Design and implement a generic, database-agnostic storage subsystem that provides object persistence using configurable serialization formats (JSON, XML, YAML) with MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control) transaction management. The storage layer treats files as pages, uses snapshot isolation for concurrent transactions, and maintains disk as the single source of truth with immediate persistence of all operations.

## Business Value
- Generic object store that can support any higher-level database abstraction
- Human-readable storage files that can be browsed on GitHub/GitLab
- Meaningful file diffs for all data changes and transaction history
- ACID transaction properties through MVCC snapshot isolation
- Immediate disk persistence ensures durability and crash recovery
- Configurable serialization formats based on user preference
- High-performance concurrent operations without repository-wide locking

## Success Criteria
- [x] Generic object store interface independent of database concepts ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Support for JSON, XML, and YAML serialization formats ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] MVCC transaction management with snapshot isolation ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] File-based page abstraction with configurable size limits ✅ **COMPLETED**

## Technical Architecture

### Namespace Translation
```
Namespace: "animals_db.animal_type"
Directory: /animals_db/animal_type/
Files: page001.json.v1234, page001.json.v1238, page002.json.v1235, ...

Namespace: "animals_db.animal_type.indexes.primary_key"  
Directory: /animals_db/animal_type/indexes/primary_key/
Files: page001.json.v1240, page001.json.v1245, ...
```

### MVCC Transaction Model
```
BEGIN TRANSACTION → Assign TSN (Transaction Sequence Number), create snapshot
OPERATIONS → Write versioned files immediately to disk, update metadata
COMMIT → Update metadata with new current versions, persist to disk
ROLLBACK → Mark transaction versions as invalid in metadata
CLEANUP → Background thread removes old versions no longer needed
```

### Immediate Persistence Strategy
```
Every operation writes to disk immediately:
- Object insertions → New version file created and flushed
- Page updates → New version file replaces old, metadata updated
- Transaction metadata → Always persisted before operation completion
- Configuration changes → Immediately written to storage.{ext}
```

### Core Components
1. **Format Adapter Pattern** - Pluggable serialization (JSON/XML/YAML)
2. **Namespace Manager** - Dot notation to folder path translation
3. **Versioned Page Manager** - File-as-page abstraction with MVCC versioning
4. **MVCC Transaction Manager** - Snapshot isolation with TSN assignment
5. **Version Metadata Manager** - Immediate persistence of version information
6. **Namespace Operation Lock Manager** - Lightweight locks for structural changes
7. **Background Cleanup Service** - Configurable version garbage collection
8. **Configuration Manager** - Auto-discovery and immediate persistence of settings

## Core Interface
```csharp
public interface IStorageSubsystem 
{
    // CRITICAL: ALL operations require active transaction for proper MVCC isolation
    
    // Transaction operations (MVCC with immediate metadata persistence)
    long BeginTransaction();
    void CommitTransaction(long transactionId);
    void RollbackTransaction(long transactionId);
    
    // Object operations (ALL require transactionId for snapshot isolation)
    string InsertObject(long transactionId, string namespace, object data);
    void UpdatePage(long transactionId, string namespace, string pageId, object[] pageContent);
    object[] ReadPage(long transactionId, string namespace, string pageId);
    Dictionary<string, object[]> GetMatchingObjects(long transactionId, string namespace, string pattern);
    
    // Structural operations (require transactionId and namespace-level operation locks)
    void CreateNamespace(long transactionId, string namespace);
    void DeleteNamespace(long transactionId, string namespace); // Blocks if operations active
    void RenameNamespace(long transactionId, string oldName, string newName);
    
    // Configuration (immediate disk persistence)
    void Initialize(string rootPath, StorageConfig config = null);
    void StartVersionCleanup(int intervalMinutes = 15);
}

// MANDATORY TRANSACTION USAGE PATTERN:
// var txnId = storage.BeginTransaction();
// try {
//     var data = storage.ReadPage(txnId, "namespace", "pageId");
//     storage.UpdatePage(txnId, "namespace", "pageId", modifiedData);
//     storage.CommitTransaction(txnId);
// } catch {
//     storage.RollbackTransaction(txnId);
// }
```

## TDD Requirements

- Create temporary directories for each test
- Initialize real file-based storage systems
- Perform actual file I/O operations with immediate persistence
- Test real serialization/deserialization with disk flush verification
- Verify actual MVCC version file creation and cleanup
- Test crash recovery scenarios with real file system state

**I want** to track exactly which versions each transaction has read  
**So that** I can detect write-write conflicts and ensure ACID isolation guarantees  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] ReadPage records the exact version TSN that was read by the transaction ✅
- [x] UpdatePage validates the transaction has read the page first (read-before-write rule) ✅
- [x] InsertObject operations do not require prior read (new pages) ✅

**CRITICAL Implementation Requirements:**
- **Version Recording**: ReadPage must record actual version read, not current version
- **Read-Before-Write**: UpdatePage cannot modify pages not read in same transaction
- **Snapshot Consistency**: All operations in transaction see data as of same TSN
- **Conflict Detection**: Any page modified after being read causes transaction abort
- **Persistence**: Read version tracking persisted in transaction metadata immediately

**TDD Requirements:**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Maintain operation counter per namespace with immediate persistence ✅
- [x] Increment counter on data operations, decrement on completion ✅
- [x] Block structural changes (delete/rename) when operations active ✅
- [x] Allow concurrent data operations within same namespace ✅
- [x] Persist operation counts to survive crashes ✅
- [x] Provide lock status visibility for debugging ✅

**Implementation Details:**
- **Operation Counting**: Maintain `ConcurrentDictionary<string, int>` for active operations
- **Persistence Strategy**: Write operation counts to `.operations.{format}` file immediately
- **Structural Blocks**: `DeleteNamespace()` waits for operation count to reach zero
- **Crash Recovery**: Reload operation counts on startup, clean up stale entries
- **No Data Blocking**: Data operations never wait for each other

**TDD Requirements:**
- [x] Test actual operation count persistence to disk ✅
- [x] Test multi-process operation counting scenarios ✅
- [x] Test structural operation blocking with real timing ✅
- [x] Test crash recovery of operation counts ✅

- **Version Identification**: Compare version TSN with oldest active transaction TSN
- **Safe Deletion**: Only delete versions with no active references
- **Metadata Updates**: Remove cleaned versions from `.versions.{format}` file immediately
- **Error Handling**: Log cleanup failures, continue with next versions
- **Monitoring**: Track cleanup frequency, versions removed, space reclaimed

**TDD Requirements:**
- [x] Test background cleanup with real file deletion ✅
- [x] Test cleanup timing with actual timer execution ✅
- [x] Test version identification accuracy with concurrent transactions ✅
- [x] Test metadata updates during cleanup with disk persistence ✅
